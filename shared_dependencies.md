4. Deployment Instructions: These are the steps to deploy the Docker container. They are defined in the Dockerfile and explained in the README.md.

5. Documentation: This is the information about the Docker container and how to use it. It is created in the Dockerfile (as comments) and expanded upon in the README.md.
